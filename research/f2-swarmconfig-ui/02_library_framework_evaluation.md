## 8. Integration Considerations

### 8.1 JSONEditor + React Integration

Several approaches exist for integrating JSONEditor with React:

1. **Existing Wrapper Libraries**: Libraries like `jsoneditor-react` provide React components that wrap JSONEditor.
2. **Custom Wrapper Components**: Creating custom wrapper components that encapsulate JSONEditor functionality.
3. **Direct DOM Manipulation**: Using refs to access DOM elements and initialize JSONEditor instances.

**Recommendation**: Use an existing wrapper library like `jsoneditor-react` if it meets the requirements, or create a custom wrapper component if more control is needed. This approach provides better integration with React's component lifecycle and state management.

### 8.2 Form-Based Editing + JSON Schema Integration

For the structured form-based editing of `documentPatterns` and `signalRules`, there are several integration approaches:

1. **Manual Form Creation**: Manually create forms based on the structure of these objects.
2. **Schema-Driven Forms**: Use a JSON Schema Form library to generate forms based on the schema.
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use React Hook Form with custom components, but derive some form structure from the schema.

**Recommendation**: A hybrid approach is likely the most effective. Use React Hook Form for the form management, but leverage the JSON Schema to derive validation rules and potentially some form structure. This provides the flexibility to create a tailored user experience while still benefiting from the schema.
