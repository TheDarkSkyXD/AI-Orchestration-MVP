# F2: Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI - Research

This directory contains research related to the Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI feature of the Pheromind Enhancements Suite.

## Research Topics

- React and TypeScript best practices for configuration editing applications
- JSON Schema definition and validation using ajv
- JSON editor components:
  - JSONEditor (josdejong/jsoneditor)
  - React-JSON-View
  - Other alternatives
- Form-based editing interfaces for complex JSON structures
- Browser-based file operations (loading and saving files)
- UI/UX considerations for configuration editing tools
- Structured editing of regex patterns and templates

## Research Outputs

Research findings, library evaluations, architectural considerations, and technical recommendations will be documented in this directory to inform the implementation of the Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI.

## JSON Schema Development

A key research output will be the development of a comprehensive JSON Schema for the `.swarmConfig` file, which will be used for validation in the UI. This schema will define the structure, required fields, data types, and constraints for all elements of the `.swarmConfig` file.
