# F3: Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe - Research

This directory contains research related to the Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe feature of the Pheromind Enhancements Suite, with a focus on Phase 1 (Enhanced Scribe Logging).

## Research Topics

- Current Pheromone Scribe implementation and architecture
- Logging best practices for AI interpretation systems
- JSONL format for structured logging
- Confidence scoring mechanisms for rule matching
- Performance considerations for enhanced logging
- Data collection strategies for future analysis
- Metrics for evaluating interpretation quality
- Approaches for identifying unmatched or poorly matched patterns

## Research Outputs

Research findings, architectural considerations, and technical recommendations will be documented in this directory to inform the implementation of the Enhanced Scribe Logging (Phase 1) of the Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe feature.

## Future Phases Considerations

While the initial implementation focuses on Phase 1 (Enhanced Scribe Logging), research in this directory will also consider requirements and approaches for future phases:

- Phase 2: Analysis & Suggestion Engine
- Phase 3: Human-in-the-Loop Review & Integration UI

This forward-looking research will help ensure that the Phase 1 implementation lays the proper foundation for subsequent phases.
