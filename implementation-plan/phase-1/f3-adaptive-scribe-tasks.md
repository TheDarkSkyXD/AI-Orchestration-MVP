# F3: Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe - Phase 1 Tasks

This document outlines the specific implementation tasks for the Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe (Phase 1: Enhanced Scribe Logging) in the Pheromind Enhancements Suite project.

## Analysis of Current Scribe Implementation

- [ ] Review the current `✍️ @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe` implementation
- [ ] Identify key points in the interpretation process for logging
- [ ] Analyze the current `.roomodes` entry for the Scribe
- [ ] Document the current interpretation workflow

## Logging Infrastructure

- [ ] Design the logging format (JSONL)
- [ ] Define the schema for log entries
- [ ] Determine log file location and naming convention
- [ ] Implement log rotation or size management
- [ ] Create logging utility functions

## Enhanced Logging Implementation

- [ ] Modify the Scribe to log the original NL summary
- [ ] Add logging for the `handoff_reason_code`
- [ ] Implement logging for matched `documentPatterns` and extracted data
- [ ] Implement logging for triggered `signalRules` and generated signals
- [ ] Add logging for unmatched or partially matched content
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring mechanism for interpretations
- [ ] Add timestamps and metadata to log entries

## Configuration

- [ ] Add configuration options for logging (enable/disable, level of detail)
- [ ] Implement configuration loading from `.swarmConfig`
- [ ] Add default configuration values
- [ ] Document configuration options

## Performance Considerations

- [ ] Optimize logging to minimize performance impact
- [ ] Implement asynchronous logging where appropriate
- [ ] Add safeguards against excessive log growth
- [ ] Test performance with and without enhanced logging

## Testing

- [ ] Create test cases with various NL summaries
- [ ] Verify log entries contain all required information
- [ ] Test confidence scoring with different types of matches
- [ ] Validate log format and structure
- [ ] Test with edge cases (very large summaries, unusual patterns)

## Documentation

- [ ] Update the `.roomodes` entry for the Scribe
- [ ] Document the log format and schema
- [ ] Create usage guide for the enhanced logging
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Add inline code documentation

## Future Phase Preparation

- [ ] Ensure log format supports future analysis needs (Phase 2)
- [ ] Document potential approaches for the Analysis & Suggestion Engine
- [ ] Identify metrics for evaluating interpretation quality
- [ ] Consider integration points for the Review UI (Phase 3)

## Acceptance Criteria

- The Scribe produces detailed JSONL logs of its interpretation process
- Logs include matched rules, confidence scores, and unparsed elements
- Logging has minimal impact on Scribe performance
- Log format is well-documented and structured for future analysis
- Configuration options allow control over logging behavior
