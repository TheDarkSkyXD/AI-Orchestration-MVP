- Refine based on initial feedback
- Prepare for Phase 1 release

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS environment
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Access to the Pheromind framework for testing
- Specific libraries:
  - **F1**: Chokidar, Socket.io, Recharts
  - **F2**: JSONEditor, Ajv
  - **F3**: Access to Pheromone Scribe source code

## Detailed Implementation Tasks

Detailed implementation tasks for each feature are documented in separate files:

- [f1-visualizer-tasks.md](./f1-visualizer-tasks.md) - Tasks for the Visual Pheromone & Documentation Landscape Tool
- [f2-swarmconfig-ui-tasks.md](./f2-swarmconfig-ui-tasks.md) - Tasks for the Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI
- [f3-adaptive-scribe-tasks.md](./f3-adaptive-scribe-tasks.md) - Tasks for the Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe

## Acceptance Criteria

The acceptance criteria for Phase 1 are derived from the overall acceptance tests, focusing on the core functionality of each feature:

### F1: Visual Pheromone & Documentation Landscape Tool

- Backend successfully watches for changes to the `.pheromone` file
- WebSocket server pushes updates to connected clients
- Frontend displays signals in a timeline/list view
- Frontend displays documentation registry entries
- Users can view details of individual signals
- Basic filtering and sorting functionality works
- Application handles errors gracefully

### F2: Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI

- Users can load `.swarmConfig` files via browser file input
- Raw JSON editor displays the content with syntax highlighting
- Validation against JSON Schema works correctly
- Validation errors are clearly displayed with paths to the problematic elements
- Users can save/download the modified `.swarmConfig` file
- Application handles errors gracefully

### F3: Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe

- The Scribe produces detailed JSONL logs of its interpretation process
- Logs include matched rules, confidence scores, and unparsed elements
- Logging has minimal impact on Scribe performance
- Log format is well-documented and structured for future analysis
- Configuration options allow control over logging behavior

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks for Phase 1

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Integration with existing Pheromind framework | Medium | High | Early testing with the framework, clear documentation of integration points |
| Performance of file watching and WebSocket updates | Medium | Medium | Performance testing with various file sizes, optimization strategies |
| Browser compatibility for file operations | Low | Medium | Testing on multiple browsers, fallback mechanisms |
| Complexity of Scribe modifications | Medium | High | Thorough analysis of existing code, incremental changes, comprehensive testing |

## Transition to Phase 2

At the end of Phase 1, the following criteria must be met to transition to Phase 2:

1. All Phase 1 acceptance criteria are satisfied
2. Core functionality of all features is implemented and tested
3. Documentation is complete
4. No critical bugs or issues remain
5. Feedback from initial testing has been addressed

Phase 2 will build upon the foundations established in Phase 1, adding advanced features and improving integration between components.
