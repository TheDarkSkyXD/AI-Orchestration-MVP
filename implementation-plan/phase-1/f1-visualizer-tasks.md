# F1: Visual Pheromone & Documentation Landscape Tool - Phase 1 Tasks

This document outlines the specific implementation tasks for the Visual Pheromone & Documentation Landscape Tool in Phase 1 of the Pheromind Enhancements Suite project.

## Backend Tasks

### 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize Node.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] Set up Express.js server
- [ ] Configure development environment (nodemon, ts-node)
- [ ] Set up linting and formatting

### 2. File Watching
- [ ] Implement file watcher using chokidar
- [ ] Configure file path via environment variables or command-line arguments
- [ ] Handle file change events
- [ ] Implement error handling for file access issues

### 3. WebSocket Server
- [ ] Set up socket.io server
- [ ] Implement connection handling
- [ ] Create event for pushing `.pheromone` updates to clients
- [ ] Implement error handling and reconnection logic

### 4. Data Processing
- [ ] Implement JSON parsing of `.pheromone` file
- [ ] Create data transformation functions for frontend consumption
- [ ] Implement basic validation of `.pheromone` content
- [ ] Add error handling for malformed JSON

## Frontend Tasks

### 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize React project with TypeScript
- [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Configure development environment
- [ ] Set up linting and formatting

### 2. WebSocket Client
- [ ] Implement socket.io client
- [ ] Handle connection and reconnection
- [ ] Set up event listeners for `.pheromone` updates
- [ ] Implement error handling

### 3. State Management
- [ ] Design state structure for `.pheromone` data
- [ ] Implement state management (React Context or similar)
- [ ] Create actions/reducers for updating state
- [ ] Handle initial loading and subsequent updates

### 4. UI Components
- [ ] Create main layout and navigation
- [ ] Implement Dashboard view with basic stats
- [ ] Create Signal Timeline/Stream view
- [ ] Implement Documentation Registry Explorer
- [ ] Create Signal Detail modal
- [ ] Add loading and error states

### 5. Filtering and Sorting
- [ ] Implement basic filtering by signal type, target, category
- [ ] Add sorting options for timeline view
- [ ] Create search functionality for documentation registry

## Testing

### 1. Backend Tests
- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Write tests for file watching
- [ ] Write tests for WebSocket communication
- [ ] Write tests for data processing

### 2. Frontend Tests
- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Write tests for WebSocket client
- [ ] Write tests for state management
- [ ] Write tests for UI components

## Documentation

- [ ] Create README with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Document API endpoints and WebSocket events
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for the tool

## Acceptance Criteria

- Backend successfully watches for changes to the `.pheromone` file
- WebSocket server pushes updates to connected clients
- Frontend displays signals in a timeline/list view
- Frontend displays documentation registry entries
- Users can view details of individual signals
- Basic filtering and sorting functionality works
- Application handles errors gracefully
