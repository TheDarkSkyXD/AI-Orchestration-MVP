# Pheromind Enhancements Suite - Overall Acceptance Tests

This directory contains the high-level acceptance tests for the Pheromind Enhancements Suite project. These tests define the ultimate success criteria for the project, focusing on end-to-end functionality and user experience rather than implementation details.

## Purpose

The acceptance tests in this directory serve several important purposes:

1. **Define Success Criteria**: They establish clear, verifiable criteria for determining when the project is successfully completed.
2. **Guide Implementation**: They provide guidance to developers on what functionality and quality attributes are expected.
3. **Support Verification**: They serve as a basis for verifying that the implemented features meet the requirements.
4. **Facilitate Communication**: They help stakeholders understand what will be delivered and how it will be evaluated.

## Test Organization

The acceptance tests are organized into the following documents:

1. **[master_acceptance_test_plan.md](./master_acceptance_test_plan.md)**: The overall test plan that defines the testing approach, methodology, and general acceptance criteria.

2. **Feature-Specific Acceptance Tests**:
   - **[f1_visualizer_acceptance_tests.md](./f1_visualizer_acceptance_tests.md)**: Tests for the Visual Pheromone & Documentation Landscape Tool.
   - **[f2_swarmconfig_ui_acceptance_tests.md](./f2_swarmconfig_ui_acceptance_tests.md)**: Tests for the Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI.
   - **[f3_adaptive_scribe_acceptance_tests.md](./f3_adaptive_scribe_acceptance_tests.md)**: Tests for the Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe (Phase 1).

## Test Structure

Each feature-specific test document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Test Categories**: Tests are organized into logical categories based on the aspect of the feature being tested (e.g., functionality, performance, usability).

2. **Individual Tests**: Each test is defined with:
   - **Test ID**: A unique identifier (e.g., F1-BE-01).
   - **Objective**: What the test aims to verify.
   - **Preconditions**: The conditions that must be met before the test can be executed.
   - **Test Steps**: The specific steps to follow when executing the test.
   - **Expected Results**: What should happen when the test is executed.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: The specific criteria that must be met for the test to pass.

## Relationship to Implementation Plan

These acceptance tests are closely aligned with the phased implementation plan for the Pheromind Enhancements Suite:

- **Phase 1**: The tests focus on the core functionality of each feature, which is the primary focus of Phase 1.
- **Phase 2**: Some tests anticipate the advanced features and integration that will be implemented in Phase 2.
- **Phase 3**: A few tests consider the refinements and intelligence aspects planned for Phase 3.

The implementation tasks defined in the phase-specific plans should be designed to satisfy these acceptance tests, ensuring that the project delivers the expected value to users.

## Test Execution

These high-level acceptance tests are intended to be executed at the end of each implementation phase to verify that the implemented features meet the requirements. They can also be used during development to guide implementation decisions and ensure that the project stays on track.

The tests are designed to be AI-verifiable, focusing on observable outcomes and simulating final user or system interactions. This approach ensures that the tests can be executed consistently and objectively, providing a reliable measure of project success.

## Maintenance

As the project evolves, these acceptance tests may need to be updated to reflect changes in requirements or implementation details. Any changes to the tests should be carefully considered and communicated to all stakeholders, as they represent changes to the project's success criteria.
