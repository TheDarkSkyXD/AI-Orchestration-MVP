# Pheromind Enhancements Suite - Master Acceptance Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the master acceptance test plan for the Pheromind Enhancements Suite project. It defines the overall testing strategy, approach, and high-level acceptance criteria that will be used to validate the successful implementation of the three key features:

1. **F1: Visual Pheromone & Documentation Landscape Tool**
2. **F2: Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI**
3. **F3: Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe (Phase 1)**

The acceptance tests defined in this plan and associated documents represent the ultimate success criteria for the project, focusing on end-to-end functionality and user experience rather than implementation details.

## 2. Testing Approach & Methodology

### 2.1 Testing Philosophy

The testing approach for the Pheromind Enhancements Suite follows the London School of Test-Driven Development (TDD), where high-level acceptance tests are defined first as the primary definition of project success. These tests focus on observable outcomes and simulate final user or system interactions.

### 2.2 Test Categories

The acceptance tests are categorized into:

1. **Functional Tests**: Verify that each feature meets its functional requirements.
2. **Non-Functional Tests**: Verify performance, usability, reliability, and other quality attributes.
3. **Integration Tests**: Verify that the features work correctly together and with the existing Pheromind framework.

### 2.3 Test Levels

Tests are organized into the following levels:

1. **High-Level End-to-End Tests**: Focus on complete user workflows and system interactions.
2. **Feature-Level Tests**: Focus on specific features or components.
3. **Component-Level Tests**: Focus on individual components or modules.

This master plan primarily addresses the high-level end-to-end tests, while feature-level and component-level tests will be defined in the phase-specific implementation plans.

## 3. Test Environment Requirements

### 3.1 Hardware Requirements

- Standard development machine with sufficient resources to run Node.js applications and modern web browsers.
- Minimum 8GB RAM recommended for smooth operation of all tools simultaneously.

### 3.2 Software Requirements

- Node.js LTS version
- Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- Access to the local file system for reading `.pheromone` and `.swarmConfig` files
- Pheromind core framework installed and operational

### 3.3 Test Data Requirements

- Sample `.pheromone` files with various signals and documentation registry entries
- Sample `.swarmConfig` files with different configurations
- Sample natural language summaries from orchestrators for testing the Scribe

## 4. Acceptance Criteria Overview

### 4.1 General Acceptance Criteria

All features must meet the following general acceptance criteria:

1. **Functionality**: All specified features and functions work as described in the requirements.
2. **Usability**: User interfaces are intuitive and follow best practices for user experience.
3. **Performance**: Applications respond within the specified time limits.
4. **Reliability**: Applications handle errors gracefully and maintain data integrity.
5. **Documentation**: Adequate documentation is provided for installation, configuration, and usage.

### 4.2 Feature-Specific Acceptance Criteria

Each feature has specific acceptance criteria that must be met:

1. **F1: Visual Pheromone & Documentation Landscape Tool**
   - Real-time visualization of `.pheromone` signals and documentation registry
   - Multiple view types (timeline, network, documentation explorer)
   - Filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Detailed signal inspection

2. **F2: Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI**
   - Loading and saving `.swarmConfig` files
   - Raw JSON editing with syntax highlighting
   - JSON Schema validation
   - Clear error reporting

3. **F3: Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe (Phase 1)**
   - Enhanced logging of the interpretation process
   - Confidence scoring for matches
   - Tracking of unmatched segments
   - Configurable logging options

## 5. Test Execution Strategy

### 5.1 Test Execution Process

1. **Setup**: Prepare the test environment and test data.
2. **Execution**: Run the tests according to the test plan.
3. **Verification**: Verify the results against the expected outcomes.
4. **Reporting**: Document the test results and any issues found.

### 5.2 Test Execution Schedule

Testing will be conducted in phases, aligned with the project's phased implementation approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Test the core functionality of each feature.
2. **Phase 2**: Test the advanced features and integration.
3. **Phase 3**: Test the refinements and overall system.

### 5.3 Entry and Exit Criteria

**Entry Criteria**:
- The feature implementation is complete and ready for testing.
- Test environment is set up and operational.
- Test data is available.

**Exit Criteria**:
- All high-level acceptance tests have been executed.
- All critical and high-priority issues have been resolved.
- The feature meets all specified acceptance criteria.

## 6. Defect Management

### 6.1 Defect Classification

Defects will be classified according to severity:

1. **Critical**: Prevents the feature from functioning; no workaround exists.
2. **High**: Significantly impacts functionality; workaround may exist.
3. **Medium**: Affects functionality but does not prevent use; workaround exists.
4. **Low**: Minor issue that does not significantly affect functionality.

### 6.2 Defect Resolution Process

1. **Identification**: Defect is identified during testing.
2. **Documentation**: Defect is documented with steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity.
3. **Assignment**: Defect is assigned to the appropriate developer.
4. **Resolution**: Developer resolves the defect.
5. **Verification**: Tester verifies the resolution.
6. **Closure**: Defect is closed if verification is successful.

## 7. Test Deliverables

The following test deliverables will be produced:

1. **Master Acceptance Test Plan** (this document)
2. **Feature-Specific Acceptance Test Plans**:
   - F1: Visual Pheromone & Documentation Landscape Tool Acceptance Tests
   - F2: Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI Acceptance Tests
   - F3: Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe Acceptance Tests
3. **Test Reports**: Documenting the results of test execution
4. **Defect Reports**: Documenting any defects found during testing

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

### 8.1 Test Team

- **Test Lead**: Responsible for overall test planning and coordination
- **Testers**: Responsible for executing tests and reporting results
- **Developers**: Responsible for resolving defects and supporting testing

### 8.2 Stakeholders

- **Project Lead**: Responsible for overall project success
- **Architects**: Responsible for ensuring the solution meets architectural requirements
- **End Users**: Provide feedback on usability and functionality

## 9. Risks and Mitigation

### 9.1 Identified Risks

1. **Integration Challenges**: The features may not integrate smoothly with the existing Pheromind framework.
2. **Performance Issues**: The applications may not meet performance requirements with large datasets.
3. **Browser Compatibility**: The web applications may not work consistently across all browsers.

### 9.2 Mitigation Strategies

1. **Early Integration Testing**: Conduct integration tests early to identify and address issues.
2. **Performance Testing**: Test with realistic and large datasets to identify performance bottlenecks.
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test on multiple browsers to ensure compatibility.

## 10. Approval and Sign-off

The acceptance of the Pheromind Enhancements Suite is contingent upon the successful completion of all high-level acceptance tests and meeting all specified acceptance criteria. Final approval and sign-off will be provided by the Project Lead after verification that all requirements have been met.
