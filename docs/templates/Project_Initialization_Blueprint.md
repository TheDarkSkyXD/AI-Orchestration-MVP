# Product Vision & Initial Blueprint

## 1. Project Overview

* **Project Name:** {{PROJECT_NAME}} 
    * *(Instruction: Replace {{PROJECT_NAME}} with the actual project name, e.g., "Aura Personal Finance Manager")*
* **Version:** 0.1 (Initial Agentic Buildout & Scaffolding)
* **Date Prepared:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}} 
    * *(Instruction: Replace {{YYYY-MM-DD}} with the current date, e.g., "2025-05-15")*
* **Prepared By:** [Senior Architect Name/Team]
* **Primary Contact:** [architect@example.com]

## 2. Vision & Goals

### 2.1. Core Product Vision
*(Instruction: Describe the overarching vision for the product. What is its long-term aspiration? What fundamental change or value does it aim to bring? This section is critical for all agents to understand the project's "why".)*
* Example: "To create a decentralized social networking platform that prioritizes user privacy, data ownership, and content creator monetization through a transparent and community-governed ecosystem."

### 2.2. Primary Goals for Initial Agentic Buildout (v0.1)
*(Instruction: List 3-5 primary, high-level goals for what this initial agent-driven setup should achieve. These will guide the swarm's research, planning, and scaffolding efforts.)*
1.  **Comprehensive Scaffolding:** Generate a complete end-to-end architectural source code and test scaffold for the application, reflecting all core modules and features specified herein.
2.  **Informed Technology Plan:** Produce detailed research artifacts (in the `/research` folder) evaluating and recommending technologies, frameworks, and patterns suitable for the project vision.
3.  **Actionable Phased Roadmap:** Develop a robust, phased implementation plan (in the `/implementation-plan` folder) that decomposes the product vision into manageable build increments, each with clear objectives, developer documentation, and test strategies.
4.  **Developer-Ready Repository:** Ensure the resulting repository is well-organized, with all generated artifacts (scaffold, research, plans) clearly documented and ready for a human development team to commence implementation.

*(Additional architect-provided files for detailed features, NFRs, data models, etc., should be co-located within `agent-specs/` in appropriate subdirectories like `agent-specs/features/`, `agent-specs/nfrs/`, `agent-specs/data_models/` and referenced here if necessary.)*

## 3. Key Features / Epics (for Initial Scaffolding & Planning)

*(Instruction: List the major features or epics. For each, briefly describe its purpose and key sub-components. The swarm will use this to structure the application scaffold and the phased implementation plan. Refer to detailed documents in `agent-specs/features/` if they exist.)*

* **Epic 1: User Identity & Management**
    * Purpose: Secure user registration, login, session management, and profile handling.
    * Key Aspects for Scaffolding: Registration flows, authentication mechanisms (consider JWT, OAuth2/OIDC placeholders), user profile data structure, API endpoint stubs.
    * Reference: `agent-specs/features/identity_management_spec.md` (if applicable)
* **Epic 2: Core Product Feature - [Epic Name, e.g., Content Creation & Feed]**
    * Purpose: [e.g., Enable users to create, share, and consume content.]
    * Key Aspects for Scaffolding: Content posting forms/APIs, feed generation logic stubs, data models for content types, interaction placeholders (likes, comments).
    * Reference: `agent-specs/features/content_feature_spec.md` (if applicable)
* **Epic 3: [Another Core Epic]**
    * Purpose: [...]
    * Key Aspects for Scaffolding: [...]

## 4. Core Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) - Initial Directives

*(Instruction: Outline critical NFRs that must inform the research, architecture, and scaffolding. Refer to detailed documents in `agent-specs/nfrs/` if they exist.)*

* **Performance:** System must be designed for responsiveness. Target perceived latency for core interactions: [e.g., <500ms].
* **Scalability:** Architect for [e.g., 100,000 active users] with potential for [e.g., X transactions/sec].
* **Security:** Prioritize secure handling of [e.g., user credentials, personal data]. Adhere to [e.g., OWASP ASVS Level 2] guidelines.
* **Maintainability:** Emphasize modularity, clear interfaces, and adherence to [e.g., Python PEP8, SOLID principles].
* **Testability:** Design for high automated test coverage; scaffold all components with corresponding test stubs.

## 5. Technology Preferences & Constraints (Initial Guidance)

*(Instruction: List any mandated technologies, preferred stacks, or constraints. If choices are open, specify areas for the research agent to investigate and propose options.)*

* **Mandatory:** [e.g., Must use PostgreSQL for primary relational data.]
* **Preferred Backend:** [e.g., Python with FastAPI, or explore Go alternatives.]
* **Preferred Frontend:** [e.g., React with TypeScript, or explore SvelteKit.]
* **Cloud Platform:** [e.g., AWS, or to be determined based on cost/feature analysis by research agent.]
* **Areas for Research Agent:**
    * Optimal decentralized identity solution.
    * Best-suited real-time messaging queue for notifications.
    * Scalable object storage for user-generated media.

## 6. Key Assumptions for This Buildout

*(Instruction: List critical assumptions provided by the architect.)*
1.  The `agent-specs` folder contains all necessary initial input for the swarm.
2.  The initial goal is a comprehensive scaffold and plan, not a production-ready application.
3.  A development team will take over post-scaffolding.

## 7. Out of Scope for Initial Buildout (v0.1)

*(Instruction: Clearly define what is NOT part of this initial agent-driven setup.)*
* [e.g., Advanced analytics dashboards.]
* [e.g., Third-party payment integrations.]

## 8. Desired Outputs from This Agentic Buildout

*(Instruction: Specify what the architect expects the swarm to produce.)*
1.  **Source Code Scaffold:** In `/src` (or as specified in the initial command).
2.  **Test Structure Scaffold:** In `/tests` (or as specified).
3.  **Research Artifacts:** In `/research` (or as specified).
4.  **Phased Implementation Plan:** In `/implementation-plan` (or as specified), including roadmap, overall acceptance tests, and per-phase documentation with developer handoff notes and phase-specific test considerations.
5.  **Architectural Documentation:** Any key diagrams or decisions made by architect agents during the process, complementing what's in `agent-specs`.

## 9. High-Level Data Concepts (for Scaffolding Guidance)

*(Instruction: Describe main data entities. Refer to detailed documents in `agent-specs/data_models/` if they exist.)*
* User ([details...])
* [Entity2] ([details...])

## 10. Known External System Interactions (for Scaffolding Interfaces)

*(Instruction: List external systems the application will need to interact with.)*
* [e.g., Email Service (interface needed)]
* [e.g., Geo-location API (interface needed)]
