# Pheromind Enhancements: Implementation Plan

**Project Version:** Pheromind v2.0 (tentative)
**Date:** 2025-05-15
**Status:** Planning

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the implementation plan for significant enhancements to the Pheromind framework. The goal is to improve observability, configurability, and the intelligence of the Pheromone Scribe agent. These enhancements are designed to be developed by AI coding agents, guided by the detailed specifications linked herein.

All specification documents for these enhancements are located within the `agent-specs/enhancements/` directory of the Pheromind repository.

## 2. Core Capabilities to be Implemented

The following key capabilities will be developed:

1.  **Visual Pheromone & Documentation Landscape Tool:** A UI application to visualize `.pheromone` signals and `documentationRegistry` contents in real-time or near real-time.
    * **Detailed Specification:** [`visualizer/F1_Visualizer_Overall_Spec.md`](./visualizer/F1_Visualizer_Overall_Spec.md)
2.  **Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI:** A UI application to facilitate easier editing, validation, and understanding of the `.swarmConfig` file, especially the `interpretationLogic`.
    * **Detailed Specification:** [`swarmconfig_ui/F2_SwarmConfig_UI_Overall_Spec.md`](./swarmconfig_ui/F2_SwarmConfig_UI_Overall_Spec.md)
3.  **Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` for Scribe:** Enhancements to the `✍️ @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe` and supporting systems to enable it to suggest improvements to its own interpretation rules.
    * **Detailed Specification:** [`adaptive_scribe/F3_Adaptive_Scribe_Overall_Spec.md`](./adaptive_scribe/F3_Adaptive_Scribe_Overall_Spec.md)

## 3. Overall Development Approach & Phasing

Development will proceed in phases, prioritizing foundational elements first.

* **Phase 1: Foundational Tools**
    * Visual Pheromone & Documentation Landscape Tool (Core functionality: file watching, basic timeline/list views).
    * Advanced `.swarmConfig` Tuning & Validation UI (Core functionality: loading, editing raw JSON, schema validation).
    * Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` - Stage 1: Enhanced Scribe Logging.
* **Phase 2: Advanced Features & Integration**
    * Visualizer: Add network graph views, advanced filtering.
    * `.swarmConfig` UI: Add structured editors for `interpretationLogic`, rule tester.
    * Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` - Stage 2: Basic Analysis & Suggestion Engine (offline tool).
* **Phase 3: Intelligence & Refinement**
    * Self-adaptive `interpretationLogic` - Stage 3: Suggestion Review UI and integration for updating `.swarmConfig`.
    * Refinements and usability improvements for all tools based on initial usage.

## 4. General Technical Guidelines

* **Modularity:** Components should be designed with clear interfaces and separation of concerns.
* **User Experience:** UIs should be intuitive, responsive, and provide clear feedback to the user.
* **Technology Stack (Recommendations - subject to detailed specs):**
    * **Frontend UIs:** Consider React with TypeScript for robust and maintainable user interfaces. Tailwind CSS for styling.
    * **Visualizer Backend (if needed):** Node.js with Express.js and WebSockets for real-time communication.
    * **File Watching:** Libraries like `chokidar` (Node.js).
    * **JSON Schema Validation:** `ajv`.
* **Code Quality:** Adhere to Pheromind's existing coding standards. Code should be well-commented, especially logic intended for AI agent consumption or modification.
* **AI-Verifiable Tasks:** Each development task assigned to a coding agent should have a clear, AI-verifiable completion criterion.
* **Testing:** Unit and integration tests should be planned for key components.

## 5. Contribution & Iteration

These specifications are a starting point. AI coding agents tasked with implementation should:
* Refer to the detailed specification document for their assigned component(s).
* Ask clarifying questions if ambiguities are found in the specs.
* Propose alternative solutions if technical challenges arise, detailing the pros and cons.
* Provide comprehensive natural language summaries of their work, including AI-verifiable outcomes, and update relevant documentation or create new documentation as needed.

This project aims to significantly enhance the Pheromind ecosystem. Collaboration between human architects/reviewers and AI coding agents will be key to its success.
